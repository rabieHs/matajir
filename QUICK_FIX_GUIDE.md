# Quick Fix Guide for Admin System

## Current Issue
You're getting a PostgreSQL infinite recursion error because of conflicting Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `profiles` table.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Fix the Database (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)

```sql
-- Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;

-- Add admin columns if they don't exist
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_blocked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS blocked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS blocked_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS blocked_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id);

-- Re-enable RLS with simple policies
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create safe policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own profile"
  ON profiles FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Service role full access"
  ON profiles FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO service_role;
```

### Step 2: Create Your Admin User

After running the above SQL, update your user account to be an admin:

```sql
-- Replace 'admin@gmail.com' with your actual email address
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = TRUE, 
    is_blocked = FALSE,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'admin@gmail.com';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT id, email, name, is_admin, is_blocked 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'admin@gmail.com';
```

### Step 3: Create Reports Table (if needed)

```sql
-- Create reports table for admin system
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    reporter_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reported_store_id UUID REFERENCES stores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reported_user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    admin_notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS and create policies
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reports"
  ON reports FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = reporter_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create reports"
  ON reports FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = reporter_id);

CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage reports"
  ON reports FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

GRANT ALL ON reports TO service_role;
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix

1. **Restart your app** (stop and run `flutter run` again)
2. **Try to register a new user** - the error should be gone
3. **Login with your admin account** - you should see the Admin button
4. **Access the admin dashboard** - all features should work

## How to Access Admin Features

1. **Create Admin Account:**
   - Use the admin setup screen (long-press app title on login)
   - OR register normally and then run the SQL to make yourself admin

2. **Login as Admin:**
   - Login with your admin credentials
   - You'll see an "Admin" button in the app
   - Click it to access the admin dashboard

3. **Admin Features Available:**
   - User Management (view, block, unblock users)
   - Category Management (create, edit, delete categories)
   - Advertisement Management (view, stop, delete ads)
   - Reports Management (handle user reports)

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get RLS errors:
```sql
-- Completely disable RLS temporarily
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reports DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE categories DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE advertisements DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### If admin features don't show:
1. Verify your user has `is_admin = TRUE` in the database
2. Restart the app completely
3. Check that you're logged in with the correct account

### If you can't access admin functions:
- Make sure the service role has proper permissions
- Check that the admin controller is properly checking admin status

## Alternative: Use Supabase Dashboard

If SQL commands don't work, you can also:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Table Editor
2. Find your user in the `profiles` table
3. Edit the row and set `is_admin` to `true`
4. Save the changes

## Success Indicators

âœ… Registration works without errors
âœ… Admin user shows "Admin" button when logged in
âœ… Admin dashboard loads and shows management options
âœ… All admin features are accessible

The admin system should now be fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
